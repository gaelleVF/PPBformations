## What is `PPB` ?

`PPB` is an R package that provides severals examples of workflow of analysis that can be used in PPB programmes.

`PPB` is based on the use of

- the data base SHiNeMaS
- the two `R` packages
    + `shinemas2R`
    + `PPBstats`

### `SHiNeMaS`
`SHiNeMaS` stands for Seeds History and Network Management System.
It is a data base that stores and organises information related to relations between seed-lots (diffusion, mixture, reproduction, selection, crosses) and data linked to relations or seed-lots.
The web site dedicated to `SHiNeMaS` is [here](http://moulon.inra.fr/index.php/en/tranverse-team/atelier-de-bioinformatique/projects/181).


### `shinemas2R`
`shinemas2R` is an `R` package to visualize outputs from the data base Seed History and Network Management System (SHiNeMaS).
The web site dedicated to `shinemas2R` is [here](https://github.com/priviere/shinemas2R).


### `PPBstats`
`PPBstats` is an `R` package for statistical analysis of unbalanced trials in decentralized participatory plant breeding programmes.
The web site dedicated to `PPBstats` is [here](https://github.com/priviere/PPBstats).

### General workflow
